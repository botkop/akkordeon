# Akkordeon: Training a neural net with Akka

The world is asynchronous. 

This project shows how to train a neural net with Akka.

The mechanics are as follows:

A layer is embedded in a [gate](#gate), and implemented as an actor. 
The results of the forward and backward pass are passed as messages from one gate (layer) to the next.
Calculations inside a layer are performed asynchronously from other layers.
Thus, a layer does not have to wait for the backward pass in order to perform the forward pass of the next batch.

Every gate has its own optimizer.
Optimization on a layer thus runs asynchronously from other layers. 
To alleviate the 'delayed gradient' problem, we use an implementation of the ['Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent with Delay Compensation'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08326) optimizer.

Data providers are embedded in [sentinels](#sentinel) and implemented as actors. You can have mutiple sentinels running at the same time, each with a subset of the training data for example.
This also allows us to run the training and validation phases concurrently.

All actors can be deployed on a single machine or in a cluster of machines, thus leveraging both horizontal and vertical computing power.

## Components

### Gate
A gate is similar to a layer. 
Every gate is an actor. 
Whereas in a traditional network there is only one optimizer for the complete network, here every gate has its own optimizer. 
There is however no difference in functionality, since optimizers do not share data between layers. 

A gate can consist of an arbitrarily complex network in itself. 
You can put multiple convolutional, pooling, batchnorm, dropouts, ... and so on in one gate. 
Or you can assign them to different gates, thus distributing the work over multiple actors.

### Network
A network is a sequence of gates.
The sequence is open. 
You can attach multiple sentinels, each with its own data provider, to the network.

### Sentinel
The sentinel is an actor, and does a couple of things:
- provide data, through the data provider, for training, validation and test
- calculate and report loss and accuracy during training and validation
- trigger the forward pass for each batch during training, validation and test
- trigger the backward pass for each batch when training

You can attach multiple sentinels to a network. 
Typically, one or more sentinels are provided for training, and one for validation. 
The latter runs every 20 seconds for example, whereas the training sentinels run continuously.

## Prepare

After having cloned/downloaded the source code of this project, get the MNIST dataset by executing the script `scripts/download_mnist.sh`
or by manually downloading the files from the URLs in the script, and putting them in a folder `data/mnist`.

You will need [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) to build the project.

## Build and run

```
sbt 'runMain botkop.akkordeon.hash.SimpleAkkordeon'
```

This will produce output similar to this:
